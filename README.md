## Hello there!

I'm a senior developer with a focus on software architecture and design. Currently I live in Bulgaria 🇧🇬 and work remotely 👨‍💻

I coded my first program in 1996 on an 8-bit computer 👾
Today I have more than 20 years of commercial software development experience and hundreds of successfully completed projects in both outsourcing and product companies.

Something else I have plenty of pasion about is alpine and sport rock climbing 🧗‍♂️
