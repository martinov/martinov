## Hello there!

I'm a software engineer with focus on SaaS solutions. Currently I live in Bulgaria 🇧🇬 and work remotely 👨‍💻

I coded my first program in 1996 on an 8-bit computer 👾. Today I have 20+ years of commercial software development experience and hundreds of successfully completed projects in various sectors including business process automation, finance, insurance, healthcare and NGOs.
